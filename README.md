For this assignment we were to:
1. Draw lanes in the background
2. Draw cars that bounce off the walls in the lanes. Make sure to use classes to randomize their speed and color. Optional: You make them continuously loop through.
3. Have a frog at the bottom of the screen that can cross the lanes.

In my code, I include a background of the game. I have a car that moves from the center of the screen to the right. I did this by making a class for the car. I used constructor, update, and show to make the car the way it is. In setup and draw, the class is called as needed. If I had more time in this lab, I would have hoped to make this game with many cars, as well as include a frog sprite that is able to move around.
